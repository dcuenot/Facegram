Spring Zuul tutorial: https://spring.io/guides/gs/routing-and-filtering/
Github: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/zuul-server & https://github.com/ExampleDriven/spring-cloud-zuul-example

Zuul always runs as standalone, for HA use 2 instances behind a LB.

In this example we have implemented filter & routing, use current implementation for further use cases.
