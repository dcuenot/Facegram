Monitoring

Responsible for monitoring all Hystrix Wrapped calls.



Tech Features
=============

Hystrix DashBoard:

Gives a visual representation of current status of all hystrix wrapped calls (Status of circuit). In order to access the
console go to: localhost:8179/hystrix and add the turbine URL turbine.stream?cluster=STORY-SERVICE (for story service)

Turbine:

Turbine enables to collect multiple hystrix streams and display them in a single dashboard.
Turbine aggregates all of the relevant /hystrix.stream endpoints into a combined /turbine.stream for use in the
Hystrix Dashboard. Individual instances are located via Eureka.


turbine.appConfig: Eureka serviceIds that turbine will use to lookup instances

turbine.aggregator.clusterConfig: Cluster Name.

eg: http://my.turbine.sever:8080/turbine.stream?cluster=<CLUSTERNAME>; CLUSTERNAME == turbine.aggregator.clusterConfig


When I register more microservices turbine  I need to do is:

Add this to the turbine
turbine:
  aggregator:
    clusterConfig: SERVICE-ONE,SERVICE-TWO  ->Describes the name of the cluster
  appConfig: SERVICE-ONE,SERVICE-TWO->Describes the services we want to monitor
  combineHostPort: true ->use a combination of hosts & ports for separating services

Turbine is not build to aggregate multiple services into the same cluster. To do this you need to add in each of the clients
the dependency of spring-boot-starter-amqp and created rabbitMQ broker. Turbine is aggregating all messages via amqp
and be able to see all Hystrix commands aggregated on hystrix dashboard server
