Monitoring

Responsible for monitoring all Hystrix Wrapped calls.



Tech Features
=============

Hystrix DashBoard:

Gives a visual representation of current status of all hystrix wrapped calls (Status of circuit). In order to access the
console go to: localhost:8179/hystrix add add the turbine URL turbine.stream?cluster=STORY-SERVICE (for story service)


TODO: Add more services

Turbine:

Turbine enables to collect multiple hystrix streams and display them in a single dashboard.
Turbine aggregates all of the relevant /hystrix.stream endpoints into a combined /turbine.stream for use in the
Hystrix Dashboard. Individual instances are located via Eureka.


turbine.appConfig: Eureka serviceIds that turbine will use to lookup instances

turbine.aggregator.clusterConfig: Cluster Name, must be always in UPPERCASE as eureka instances are always in UPPERCASE

eg: http://my.turbine.sever:8080/turbine.stream?cluster=<CLUSTERNAME>; CLUSTERNAME == turbine.aggregator.clusterConfig


When I register more microservices turbine may NOT work Wha I need to do is:

1) Add the follow to each service I want to monitor
    https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/issues/948
eureka:
  instance:
    metadataMap:
      cluster: MYCLUSTER

2) Add this to the turbine
turbine:
  aggregator:
    clusterConfig: MYCLUSTER
  appConfig: microservice-one,microservice-two,zuul-server
  clusterNameExpression: metadata['cluster']
  combineHostPort: true
