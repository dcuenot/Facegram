Tech Features
=============
Hystrix:

Every call to the backend (currently mocked my JFairy, in the future a mongoDB) is wrapped as a Hystrix Control, this
gives as the ability to handle failures (in a fallback method) and use Circuit Breaker Pattern.

JFairy:

A nice beta project that helps you mock real-like data as Credit Cards, Paragraphs, Names etc.
